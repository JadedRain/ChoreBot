**_A Discord bot to assign chores in a server to complete_**


The purpose of this project is to distribute and remind people in a dorm room to do their chores. Every week chores are assigned those possessing a role in a discord server. These users will then be reminded every day at a time of day that there are still chores that need to be completed for the week. By default chores are reset at the start of every week and are distributed between members again. Punishment for what happens if chores aren't completed by the end of the week are decided by the other people in the dorm.
